🧭 Sidebar (Company Selector)

    * Search bar on top 🔍
    * List of companies from a JSON file
    * On-click → highlight & load that company’s runs into main view
    * Show a field qs badge next to each company (export / import / transit)
    * Option to "pin" companies you care about to top
    * Cache company list on frontend to avoid hitting backend on every search

📊 Main View (Logic Apps Style Table)

    * Table like Azure Logic Apps run history (clone every piece of ui)
    * Run ID, Status, Time, Duration
    * Click row → show modal
    * Auto-refresh toggle every 10 mins
    * Table can be filtered by (status, Time interva (Last 24 hours, Last 48 hours..., custom))
    * Load run data only when needed to keep things fast like (Showing 40 runs and See more)
    * Add a “loading...” state for UX smoothness

🧩 Modal Details (Per Run)

    * Step visualizer (like a flowchart with arrows) (preferable to be same as logic apps that incredible)
    * Email button to send the report with all details to the dev team and it's gonna be easy to handle

⚙️ Tech thoughts

    * Vanilla JS - EJS (wihout layout) - Vanilla CSS
